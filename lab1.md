# Exercise 1:
2.
- CPU brand: macOS, model: Apple M2, number of cores: 8
- Total RAM: 16gb, type LPDDR5
- Storage device type: SSD, capacity: 228Gi
- Operating System version: Sequoia 15.6.1
3. **Analysis Question:**
- It can theoretically handle 8 tasks at once.
- My Mac uses an NVMe SSD, which is much faster than an HDD.
- My Mac has 16 GB of RAM, which is good for creative apps, light video editing, and running multiple apps simultaneously.


# Exercise 2:
**Challenge Questions:**
- The process using the most resources on my Mac is WindowSever. Because it’s responsible for rendering everything on screen, its CPU usage increases when many apps or windows are open.
- If the operating system didn’t manage memory automatically, apps would conflict over RAM, leading to crashes, data corruption, and poor performance.
- My macOS protects me from security threats using Gatekeeper to block unverified apps, XProtect to detect andd remove malware, and System Integrity Protection to prevent tampering with system files. FileVault encrypts my data.
