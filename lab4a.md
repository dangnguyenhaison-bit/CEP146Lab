# Fried Rice Receipt
## Ingredients  
- 2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old)  
- 2 eggs  
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn)  
- 2 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp cooking oil  
- Salt and pepper to taste  

## Cooking Steps  
1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.  
2. Crack the eggs into the pan, scramble lightly, and cook until just set.  
3. Add mixed vegetables and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes.  
4. Add the cooked rice and break up any clumps.  
5. Pour in soy sauce and mix evenly.  
6. Season with salt and pepper.  
7. Stir-fry for another 2–3 minutes until everything is hot.  

**Tip: Always use cold, leftover rice — it prevents the dish from becoming mushy.**
